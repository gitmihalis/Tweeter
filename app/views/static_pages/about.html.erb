  Tweet was built following the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails
  Tutorial</em></a> by Michael Hartl. There is a
  <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">book</a> and
  <a href="http://screencasts.railstutorial.org/">screencast series</a>
  to teach web development with
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.

<p> After completing the tutorial, I added the favorite feature for the microposts to show understanding and make it my own. Take it for a spin!</p>
