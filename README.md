# Tweeter is built from the Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is my feature implementation to the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Customization by _Mihalis Fthenos_

To show understanding and competence I implemented my own **favorites feature**, without aid from any tutorial or source code. Users can add and remove favorites that show up in their own favortires feed.

## License

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/)
is available jointly under the MIT License and the Beerware License. See
[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).
